Logging to Logentries in Ruby
=============================

This is a Logentries library for logging from Ruby platforms, including Heroku.

It is available on github <https://github.com/logentries/le_ruby/> and rubygems
<http://rubygems.org/>.


Example
-------

    Rails.logger.info("information message")
    Rails.logger.warn("warning message")
    Rails.logger.debug("debug message")


Howto
-----

You must first register your account details with Logentries. 

Once you have logged in to Logentries, create a new host with a name of your choice.
Inside this host, create a new logfile, selecting `Token TCP` as the source type.

Heroku
------

To install the gem you must edit the Gemfile in your local heroku environment

Add the following line:

    gem 'le', '2.1.3'

Then from the cmd line run the following command:

    bundle install

This will install the gem on your local environment.

The next step is to configure the default rails logger to use the logentries
logger.

In your `config/environments/production.rb` file, add the following:

    Rails.logger = Le.new('LOGENTRIES_TOKEN')
    
If you want to keep also the logs in the console just add true after the key:

    Rails.logger = Le.new('LOGENTRIES_TOKEN', true)

This will set the rails logger to use the Logentries logger in production and log to the console in development environment.

For the `LOGENTRIES_TOKEN` argument, paste the token for the logfile you created earlier in the Logentries UI.

Now, simply use `Rails.logger.info("message")` inside your code to send logs to Logentries
